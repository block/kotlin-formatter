# Example lefthook.yml for kotlin-formatter integration
#
# This file demonstrates the recommended lefthook configuration for
# automatic Kotlin code formatting on pre-commit.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Install lefthook: `hermit install lefthook` (or via brew/npm)
#   2. Copy this file to your project root as `lefthook.yml`
#   3. Run `lefthook install` to install the hooks
#
# The pre-commit hook will:
#   - Run in parallel with other pre-commit tasks
#   - Format only staged Kotlin files
#   - Stage the formatted changes automatically
#   - Exit with non-zero if formatting changes were needed

pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    format:
      glob: "*.{kt,kts}"
      run: bin/kotlin-format --set-exit-if-changed {staged_files}
      stage_fixed: true
